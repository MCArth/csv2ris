TI  - " In the driver's seat" : The Health Sector Strategic Master Plan as an instrument for aid coordination in Mongolia.
AB  - In 2005, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mongolia initiated the process of developing its Health Sector Strategic Master Plan (HSSMP), using a wide-ranging consultative process, driven by the MoH, and requiring participation from all levels of health facilities, other ministries, donor agencies and NGOs. Among other objectives, the MoH sought to coordinate the disparate inputs from key donors through the HSSMP, aligning them with the Plan's structure. This research explores the extent to which the HSSMP process served as a mechanism for effective aid coordination while promoting ownership and capacity building and the lessons learned for the wider international development community. The study is based on document review, key-informant interviews and authors' experience and participation in the MoH planning processes. The HSSMP process improved alignment and harmonisation. It enabled a better local understanding of the benefits of aid coordination, and the recognition that aid coordination as not only a mere administrative task, but a strategic step towards comprehensive management of both domestic and external resources. The process was not challenge free; the fractious political environment, the frequent turnover of key MoH staff, the resistance of some donors towards MoH scrutiny over their programmes and the dismantling of the central coordination and return of seconded staff following completion of the HSSMP, has slowed the pace of reform. Despite the challenges, the approach resulted in positive outcomes in the areas of ownership and better aid coordination, with HSSMP development emphasising ownership and capacity building. This contrasted with the usual outcomes focus, and neglect of the capacity building learning processes and structural and policy changes needed to ensure sustainable change. The largest and most influential programmes in the health sector are now largely aligned with HSSMP strategies, enabling the MoH to utilize these opportunities to optimise the HSSMP outcomes. The lessons for Ministries of Health in similar Post-Soviet countries--or other emerging economies where government capacity and local policy processes are relatively strong--are clear: the development of solid governance and technical infrastructure in terms of planning and evaluation provide a solid structure for donor coordination and insure against local political change. ? 2014 Ulikpan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - "A short trauma course for physicians in a resource-limited setting: Is low-cost simulation effective?".
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Morbidity and mortality from intentional and unintentional injury accounts for a high burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries. In addition to prevention measures, interventions that increase healthcare capacity to manage injuries may be an effective way to decrease morbidity and mortality. A trauma curriculum tailored to low-resource settings was implemented in Managua, Nicaragua utilising traditional didactic methods and novel low-cost simulation methods. Knowledge gain in attending and senior residents was subsequently assessed by using pre- and post-written tests, and by scoring pre- and post-simulation scenarios.;MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5-day trauma course was designed for Nicaraguan attending and senior resident physicians who practice at six hospitals in Managua, Nicaragua. On days 1 and 5, participants underwent pre- and post-training evaluations consisting of a 26-question written exam and 2 simulation cases. The written exam questions and simulations were randomly assigned so that no questions or cases were repeated. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre- and post-training differences in the written exam, and the percentage of critical actions completed in simulations. Time to critical actions was also analyzed using descriptive statistics.;RESULTS: A total of 33 participants attended the course, including 18 (55%) attending and 15 (45%) resident physicians, with a 97% completion rate. After the course, overall written examination scores improved 26.3% with positive mean increase of 15.4% (p<0.001). Overall, simulation scores based on the number of critical actions completed improved by 91.4% with a positive mean increase of 33.67 (p<0.001). The time to critical action for completion of the primary survey and cervical spine immobilisation was reduced by 55.9% and 46.6% respectively.;CONCLUSIONS: A considerable improvement in participants' knowledge of trauma concepts was demonstrated by statistically significant differences in both pre- and post-course written assessments and simulation exercises. The participants showed greatest improvement in trauma simulation scenarios, in which they learned, and subsequently demonstrated, a standardised approach to assessing and managing trauma patients. Low-cost simulation can be a valuable and effective education tool in low- and middle-income countries.;Copyright ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - "Anything Can Happen in a Story--You Can Even Meet a Baboon Shopping in Town": Authors Encouraging Children as Writers.
AB  - A writing workshop held during a school holiday in an urban center in Southern Africa illustrated the premise that writing experiences with literary patrons can result in benefits for young authors. The workshop was planned with the purpose of encouraging children to write in a setting that emphasized the establishment of a children's library, a related literature-based listening program and a community approach to the sharing of ideas (with experienced writers, group leaders, parents, older children, and peer groups). A multi-age group of primary and early secondary school children (16 in all) participated in the 3-week workshop. Specific workshop activities included storytelling, modeling, revising, editing, learning audience awareness, "languaging," i.e., becoming aware of overused words and hackneyed phrases and being alert to appropriate substitutes; and publishing, i.e., making permanent "hard-cover" books out of their own selected writings. The group conferences exerted a positive influence and as a result a confident outlook about reading and writing seemed to emerge. Parents indicated that they saw their children enjoying reading and writing. Children said that they read to try to understand the characters and "other things." They also read to look at the illustrations in the stories and to just enjoy a good story. By asking experienced writers to join the team of adult leaders, the children were not only given opportunities to write and learn how their writing unfolds but also to communicate to real audiences (audiences which included professional writers). (Figures representing a sample cluster, guidelines for editing or revising, student and parent inventories, and a sample "diploma" for workshop participants are included; 25 references are attached.)

TI  - "APEC blue"-The effects and implications of joint pollution prevention and control program.
AB  - To ensure good air quality in Beijing during Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) China 2014, Beijing and its neighboring five provinces and the associated cities were combined under the Joint Prevention and Control of Atmospheric Pollution (JPCAP) program, which implemented rigorous cooperative emission reduction measures. The program was a unique and large-scale artificial experiment that showed that such measures can achieve excellent results, and it led to the popular "APEC blue" catchphrase (i.e., Beijing's skies became blue as pollution levels decreased). This artificial experiment provided the means to effectively conduct JPCAP strategies in the future. Accordingly, our research focused on the characteristics of the six primary pollutants in Beijing. We found that the JPCAP measures directly reduced concentrations of all pollutants except O<inf>3</inf>. Through correlation analysis, we found that the band distribution of the cities with strong correlations in PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations was affected by wind conditions. Therefore, JPCAP measures should account for specific seasonal and climatic conditions. Based on cluster analysis using the results from the correlation analysis, we divided 13 cities within a 300-km radius of Beijing into different groups according to the similarity of their PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> correlation coefficients. For JPCAP measures relevant to PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf>, we found differences in the degrees of collaboration among cities. Therefore, depending upon the pollutant type, the JPCAP strategy should account for the cities involved, the scope of the core area, and the optimal cities to involve in the collaborative efforts based on cost-effectiveness and collaborative difficulty among the involved cities.

TI  - "Aprender a Convivir." A Prevention Program for Improving Social Competence in Three-to Seven-Year-Olds
AB  - Behavior problems are often observed in classrooms. The age at which problems appears is increasingly younger, and there are no interventions that ensure a reduction in such behavior problems among school age children. Research and previous evidence show the importance of social competence in this kind of prevention. Working with preschool and primary students must be the main objective, because social competence is a protective factor against behavior problems. In response to these social and educational problems, American and European countries have begun to include universal prevention programs in their curriculum, the ensure the learning of social competence at school. As an example, the pioneering program "Aprender a Convivir" [Learn to Live Together] can be considered a preventive intervention that encourages the innovative and optimal development of prosocial behavior in three- to seven year-old children. Its main contents are: rules, feelings and emotions, empathy, communication skills, interpersonal skills, assertiveness and problem solving skills. The framework focuses on increasing social competence and decreasing behavior problems, with the long term results of preventing antisocial behavior. The present contribution aims to first show the importance of working on social competence at school, and second, to present the "Aprender a Convivir" program. This program has been implemented in cities of Spain (Granada, Zaragoza), and in other Spanish-speaking countries (Bolivia, Dominican Republic), showing significant differences in the growth of social competence and the reduction of behavior problems.

TI  - "Body packers" in Israel: A case series.
AB  - Background: "Body packers" swallow multiple packets filled with illicit drugs, mainly cocaine, in order to smuggle them across international borders. In recent years, an increasing number of body packers have been hospitalized after their detention by the police upon arrival in Israel. Objectives: To characterize the clinical features and outcomes of body packers hospitalized at the Sheba Medical Center. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case series of body packers hospitalized between January 2010 and October 2012 in our medical center. Electronic medical records and imaging files were reviewed to extract clinical, laboratory and radiological data as well as details on medical treatments. Results: We identified 23 body packers (mean age 38 +/- 10 years), 20 of whom smuggled cocaine from South America. The number of packets transported ranged from 1 to 242 (median 42) and duration of hospitalization from 1 to 14 days (median 2). Two subjects required surgical intervention. All others were treated conservatively by polyethylene glycolelectrolyte lavage solution, laxatives, or watchful waiting. Ten patients underwent a urinary screen for illicit drugs, 7 of whom tested positive for cocaine and 2 for cannabinoids. Abdominal X-rays were performed in all patients at admission, and 14 had follow-up imaging, including abdominal CT scans without contrast media in 8. Conclusions: The main treatment goals for body packers are the rapid excretion of drug packets and early detection of complications, i.e., drug intoxication and bowel obstruction. We suggest the use of a structured treatment approach for the in-hospital management of body packers.

TI  - "Can the transtheoretical model motivate patients with coronary heart disease to exercise?": Retracted. [References].
AB  - The preliminary effects of a transtheoretical model-based exercise stage-matched intervention on exercise behavior in sedentary patients with coronary heart disease were examined in this study. This was a pilot randomized, controlled trial. A total of 18 eligible patients with coronary heart disease were recruited and randomized to either a conventional group, a patient-education group, or an exercise stage-matched intervention group. Exercise behavior was measured by exercise stages of change, exercise self-efficacy, exercise decisional balance, and moderate-intensity exercise duration (min/week) at baseline and immediately after the eight week intervention.When compared to baseline, only patients in the exercise stage-matched intervention group demonstrated significant progress in the exercise stages of change, higher exercise self-efficacy, fewer exercise barriers, and longer duration of moderate-intensity exercise after the eight week intervention. A significant difference in the progress in the exercise stages of change was found among the three groups after the eight week intervention. The findings suggest that the transtheoretical model-based exercise stage-matched intervention has potentially-positive effects on motivating sedentary patients with coronary heart disease to engage in exercise.

TI  - "Class smoke-free" pledge impacts on nicotine dependence in male adolescents: A cluster randomized controlled trial. [References].
AB  - Objective: To test the effectiveness of a school-based, peer-led smoking and asthma education program with an additional "class smoke-free" pledge on smoking-related knowledge and perception, nicotine dependence, and asthma control in male high school students in Jordan 4 months post-intervention. Methods: In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, four male schools in Irbid, Jordan, were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 215) or comparison (n = 218) groups. Trained educators trained senior students from the four schools to be peer leaders (n = 53), who then taught peers in grades 7 and 8 (n = 433). The peer leaders in the intervention schools implemented the smoke-free pledge within the 7th and 8th graders, who voluntarily signed the pledge for 4 months. The comparison group received the same intervention components as the intervention group, minus the smoke-free pledge. Data were collected from students in grades 7 and 8 at baseline and 4 months post-intervention. Results: Students from the intervention group reported significant improvements in smoking-related knowledge and perception and lower nicotine dependence as compared to the comparison group. Improvement in asthma control was greater in nonsmokers versus smokers. Conclusions: Voluntary group commitment smoke-free through a pledge is an incentive to motivate adolescents to abstain from smoking. Using social influences approaches in schools is useful in countering current aggressive tobacco marketing campaigns in Arab youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - "Class-Bucks": A Motivational Tool to Encourage Active Student Participation during Lectures
AB  - The purpose of this study was to ascertain the influence of an extrinsic motivational tool, "class-bucks," on the possibility of improving first year student-teachers' participation in active learning at Tshwane University of Technology in South Africa. Research participants (n=289) were divided into four classes and engaged in this study during the second and third semester of the course. During the second semester, the students in Class 1 and Class 2 were awarded with "class-bucks" for active participation in lectures, while Classes 3 and 4 were not awarded. Then, during the third semester, the students in Classes 3 and 4 were awarded, while those in Classes 1 and 2 were not. Semester test results and the number of instances of active participation during lectures were recorded and compared to formulate findings and recommendations. The results presented in this article will assist lecturers in valuing an extrinsic motivational tool, "class-bucks," which can be used to encourage active student participation during lectures, thus contributing to the expansion of quality education and improving the student's ability to retain learning content for longer.
